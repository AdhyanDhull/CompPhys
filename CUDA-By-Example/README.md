# `CUDA-By-Example` CUDA by Example
#### cf. Jason Sanders, Edward Kandrot. **CUDA by Example: An Introduction to General-Purpose GPU Programming**

I also cloned in this same repository the github repository from [jiekebo](https://github.com/jiekebo) for [CUDA-By-Example](https://github.com/jiekebo/CUDA-By-Example), and this is a general observation: it may help to first search on github for the code you seek because it seems likely that someone already wrote it.

## Note on examples out of CUDA by Example

It seems that a header file `book.h` out of the `common` subdirectory is needed to run the scripts.  I've tried to write my own scripts without needing the `book.h` header.  However, it's found in jiekebo's repository and in this repository, in the subdirectory (from here) `CUDA-By-Example`.  I don't know the rationale behind `book.h` or why the authors made you need it for their examples (as I am reading the book, it's not explained (!!!)).

## Dictionary between files on this github subdirectory to code in **CUDA By Example**, *Sanders and Kandrot*

I'm also looking at Bjarne Stroustrup's **A Tour of C++** (2013) Addison-Wesley, and Stroustrup (2013) refers to this text.

### Querying Devices
cf. 3.3 Querying Devices of Sanders and Kandrot (2010).

Take a look at `query.cu`.  

It appears that `cudaDeviceCount` obtains the total number of devices.  For example, in my case, it is 1, so that `count == 1`.  `cudaGetDeviceProperties` retrieves the properties of a device (specified by that count number).  One of those properties is its name, evoked by `.name`.  In my case, for example, after compiling `query.cu` by doing `nvcc query.cu`, then running the executable, by doing `./a.out`, then I obtain:
```
Name: GeForce GTX 980 Ti
```

Then `queryb.cu` has further properties that you "evoke" by various "methods" of the class, e.g. `.name`, `.major`, `.minor`, etc.
