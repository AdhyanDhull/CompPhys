# Cpp14 - C++ code snippets and examples for C++11/C++14 standard

## Abstract

> C++ feels like a new language. That is, I can express my ideas more clearly, more simply, and more directly in C++11 than I could in C++98.  Furthermore, the resulting programs are better checked by the compiler and run faster. -*Bjarne Stroustrup*

This directory contains C++ code snippets and examples formulated entirely in the C++11/C++14 standard.  I sought to "borax" away any backwards-compatibility or previous code practices and to adopt anew best coding practices that are apt to this latest C++11/C++14 standard.

### Dynamic Memory; smart pointers, `shared_ptr`    
cf. Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, Barbara E. Moo.  **C++ Primer** (5th Edition) 5th Edition.  *Addison-Wesley Professional*; 5 edition (August 16, 2012).  ISBN-13: 978-0321714114.  

cf. Ch. 12. Dynamic Memory.  

"So far", prior, or prior to C++11/14, objects had well-defined lifetimes.  
- global objects allocated at program startup and destroyed when program ends  
- local, automatic objects are created and destroyed when block they're defined in is entered and exited.  
- local `static` objects allocated before their 1st use and destroyed when program ends.  

Dynamically allocated objects have lifetime that's independent of where they're created; *they exist until they're explicitly freed.*  

Programs "so far" have used only static or stack memory.  
- static memory used for local `static` objects (cf. Sec. 6.1.1, p. 205 of Lippman, Lajoie, Moo (2012)), for class `static` data members (cf. Sec. 7.6, p. 300 of Lippman, Lajoie, Moo (2012)), and for variables defined outside any function  
    * `static` objects allocated before they're used; destroyed when program ends  
- stack memory used for nonstatic objects defined inside functions  
    * stack objects exist only while block in which they're defined is executing  
- Objects allocated in static or stack memory are automatically created and destroyed by compiler  

#### **heap** or **free store**  
**heap** or **free store** - program has a pool of memory it can use and programs use the heap for objects they **dynamically allocate**, i.e. objects that program allocates at run time.  
    - program controls lifetime of dynamic objects; code must explicitly destroy such objects when they're no longer needed.
