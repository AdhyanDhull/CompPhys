# Cpp14 - C++ code snippets and examples for C++11/C++14 standard

## Abstract

> C++ feels like a new language. That is, I can express my ideas more clearly, more simply, and more directly in C++11 than I could in C++98.  Furthermore, the resulting programs are better checked by the compiler and run faster. -*Bjarne Stroustrup*

This directory contains C++ code snippets and examples formulated entirely in the C++11/C++14 standard.  I sought to "borax" away any backwards-compatibility or previous code practices and to adopt anew best coding practices that are apt to this latest C++11/C++14 standard.

### Basic ways to make or construct unique pointers to arrays:  

```  
auto uptr11 = std::unique_ptr<float[]>{ new float[42]};     // since C++11
``` 
```
auto uptr14 = std::make_unique<float[]>(42);                // since C++14
```  
And then access the entries this way:
```  
for (int i =0; i<42 ; i++) {
    std::cout << uptr11[i] << " " << uptr14[i] << " ";
    uptr11[i] = i*11.f;
    uptr14[i] = i*140.f;    
    std::cout << " " << i << " : " << uptr11[i] << " " << uptr14[i]  << std::endl;
}   
```  

## (even more) File I/O  

Please see [`CompPhys/Cpp/README.md`](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/Cpp/README.md) for my original implementations of File I/O, especially the pure C++ implementations of File I/O for writing `.csv` files.  I will try to summarize and make concise those exact same contents (duplicate) here as well, if necessary.  

### File I/O with binary format; and empirically, C++11/C++14 is the way to go  

[PanicSheep](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1112378/panicsheep) did great work in empirically comparing 3 cases of writing to binary.  The gist of the code is the following:  

cf. [Writing a binary file in C++ very fast, stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11563963/writing-a-binary-file-in-c-very-fast)

```  
long long option_1(std::size_t bytes) 
{
	std::vector<uint64_t> data = GenerateData(bytes);
	
	auto myfile = std::fstream("file.binary", std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
	myfile.write((char*)&data[0],bytes);
	myfile.close();
}

long long option_2(std::size_t bytes)
{
	std::vector<uint64_t> data = GenerateData(bytes);
	
	FILE* file = fopen("file.binary", "wb");
	fwrite(&data[0], 1, bytes, file);
	fclose(file);
}
	
long long option_3(std::size_t bytes)
{
	std::vector<uint64_t> data = GenerateData(bytes);
	
	std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	auto myfile = std::fstream("file.binary", std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
	myfile.write((char*)&data[0], bytes);
	myfile.close();
}
```  

`std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio` sets whether standard C++ streams are synchronized to the standard C streams after each input/output operation.  

The standard C streams are `stdin, stdout` and `stderr`.  

In practice, synchronized C++ streams are unbuffered, and each I/O operation on a C++ stream is immediately applied to the corresponding C stream's buffer.  This makes it possible to freely mix C++ and C I/O.  

Also, synchronized C++ streams are guaranteed to be thread-safe (individual characters output from multiple threads may interleave, but no data races occur).  

If synchronization is turned off, the C++ standard streams are allowed to buffer their I/O independently, which may be considerably faster in some cases.

## [The rule of 3/5/0](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three); user-defined destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment/ move constructor, move assignment  

### why Rule of 5  

Because of presence of user-defined destructor, copy-constructor, or copy-assignment operator prevents implicit definition of the move constructor, and move assignment operator  

### [move constructors](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/move_constructor) 

move constructor of class `T` (or `cls` is my notation), is non-template constructor whose 1st parameter is `T&&`, `const T&&`, `volatile T&&`, or `const volatile T&&`.  and either there are no parameters, or rest of parameters all have default values.  (i.e. `cls&&`, `const cls&&`, `volatile cls&&`, `const volatile cls&&`)    

**Syntax**  
```  
class_name( class_name && )  
class_name( class_name &&) = default; 
class_name( class_name &&) = delete; 
```  

Move constructor called whenever by overload, which typically occurs when object is initialized from `rvalue` of same type, including  
* initialization: e.g. `T a = std::move(b);` or `T a(std::move(b));` 
* function argument passing: `f(std::move(a));`  
* function return: `return a;`  

e.g. `movconstruct.cpp`, notes: 

```  
struct A 
{
	std::string s;
	// struct constructor 
	A() : s("test") { }
	// copy constructor
	A(const A& o) : s(o.s) { std::cout << "move failed!\n"; } 
	// move constructor
	A(A&& o) noexcept : s(std::move(o.s)) { }
}; 


struct B : A
{
	std::string s2;
	int n;
	// implicit move constructor B::(B&&) 
	// calls A's move constructor 
	// calls s2's move constructor
	// and makes a bitwise copy of n 
}; 

struct C : B 
{
	~C() { } 	// destructor prevents implicit move constructor C::(C&&) 
}; 

C c1;
C c2 = std::move(c1); // calls copy constructor 
// fails to move for c1 -> c2!
```   

`C`, when moving it, fails, because user-defined destructor (almost always case with classes) prevents implicit move constructor. Solution is to have a user-defined move constructor.    


```  
struct D : B 
{
	D() {  }
	~D() {  }			// destructor would prevent implicit move constructor D::(D&&) 
	D(D&&) = default; 	// forces a move constructor anyways 
}; 
```  
cf. Scott Meyers. **Effective Modern C++**.  pp. 115, Item 17  

** Move constructor** and ** move assignment operator**: each performs memberwise moving of non-static data members.  Generated (automatically) only if class contains no user-declared copy operations, move operations, or destructor.  

EY : 20171201 - compiler knows to select the overload with move constructor or generate (automatically) a move constructor?  

## Glossary/Dictionary/Quick Look Up  

`noexcept` specifier - specifies whether a function will throw exceptions or not   

** Syntax **  
  
**`noexcept`**  				 (1)
**`noexcept`**( *expression* )	 (2)  
  
1. Same as **`noexcept ( true ) ` **  
2. If *expression* evaluates to `true`, function is declared to not throw any exceptions.  



`override` - override specifier (>C++11) - specifies that virtual function overrides another virtual function, e.g.  
```  
struct A
{
    virtual void foo();
    void bar();
};

struct B : A
{
    void foo() const override;  // Error: B::foo does not override A::foo
                                // (signature mismatch)
    void foo() override;        // OK: B::foo overrides A::foo
    void bar() override;        // Error: A::bar is not virtual 
};
```  

`decltype` - `decltype` specifier (since C++11) - inspects declared type of an entity or the type and value category of an expression  

### `std::iota`  
Defined in header `<numeric>`  
```  
template<class ForwardIterator, class T>  
void iota(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last, T value);  
```  
### smart pointers  

#### [`std::unique_ptr`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr)

Defined in header `<memory>`.  

```  
template<  
    class T,  
    class Deleter = std::default_delete<T>  
> class unique_ptr;  
  

template <  
    class T,  
    class Deleter  
> class unique_ptr<T[], Deleter>;  
```  		

`std::unique_ptr` is a smart pointer that owns and manages another object through a pointer and disposes of that object when the `unique_ptr` goes out of scope. 

cf. Scott Meyers. **Effective Modern C++**.  pp. 118, Item 18 Use `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive-ownership resource management.   

`std::unique_ptr` same size as raw pointers, and for most operations (including dereferencing), they execute exactly the same instructions.  This means you can use them even in situations where memory and cycles are tight.  If a raw pointer is small enough and fast enough for you, a `std::unique_ptr` almost certainly is, too.  

`std::unique_ptr` embodies *exclusive ownership* semantics.  A non-null `std::unique_ptr` always owns what it points to  
* Moving `std::unique_ptr` transfers ownership from source pointer to the destination pointer. (Source pointer is set to null).  
* Copying `std::unique_ptr` isn't allowed  
* Upon destruction, a non-null `std::unique_ptr` destroys its resource, `delete` to the raw pointer by default  

Use `decltype` specifier (prefix) when making your own destructor.  By definition, [`decltype`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype) "inspects the declared type of an entity or type and value category of an expression."  But it's "useful when declaring types that are difficult or impossible to declare using standard notation, like lambda-related types or types that depend on template parameters."    

"Converting a `std::unique_ptr` to a `std::shared_ptr` is easy.  (Meyers, pp. 124, Item 18)

I'm thinking you can use `.release` - returns a pointer to the managed object and releases the ownership.   

##### [overhead for `std::unique_ptr`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22295665/how-much-is-the-overhead-of-smart-pointers-compared-to-normal-pointers-in-c)   

`std::unique_ptr` has memory overhead if you provide it with some non-trivial deleter.  

`std::unique_ptr` has time overhead only during constructor (if it has to copy provided deleter and/or null-initialize the pointer), and during destructor (to destroy the owned object).  


##### [overhead for `std::shared_ptr`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22295665/how-much-is-the-overhead-of-smart-pointers-compared-to-normal-pointers-in-c)   

`std::shared_ptr` always has memory overhead for reference counter, but it's very small.  

`std::shared_ptr` has time overhead in constructor (to create reference counter), in destructor (to decrement reference counter and possibly destroy the object), and assignment operator (to increment reference counter).  
Due to thread-safety guarantees of `std::shared_ptr`, these increments/decrements are atomic, thus adding some more overhead.    

cf. Meyers, pp. 125, Item 19: Use `std::shared_ptr` for shared-ownership resource management.  

An object accessed via `std::shared_ptrs` has its lifetime managed by those pointers through *shared ownership*.  
No specific `std::shared_ptr` owns the object.  Instead, all `std::shared_ptrs` pointing to it collaborate to ensure its destruction at the point where it's no longer needed.  When last `std::shared_ptr` pointing to an object stops pointing there (e.g. because `std::shared_ptr` is destroyed or made to point to a different object), `std::shared_ptr` destroys object it points to.  

A `std::shared_ptr` can tell whether it’s the last one pointing to a resource by con‐ sulting the resource’s *reference count*, a value associated with the resource that keeps track of how many `std::shared_ptrs` point to it.  
`std::shared_ptr` constructors increment this count (usually),  
`std::shared_ptr` destructors decrement it, and   
copy assignment operators do both.  
(If `sp1` and `sp2` are `std::shared_ptrs` to different objects, the assignment “`sp1 = sp2;`” modifies `sp1` such that it points to the object pointed to by `sp2`.  
The net effect of the assignment is that the reference count for the object originally pointed to by `sp1` is decremented, while that for the object pointed to by `sp2` is incremented.)  
If a `std::shared_ptr` sees a reference count of zero after performing a decrement, no more `std::shared_ptrs` point to the resource, so the `std::shared_ptr` destroys it. 

* **`std::shared_ptrs` are twice the size of a raw pointer**, because they internally contain a raw pointer to the resource as well as a raw pointer to the resource’s reference count. 
* **Memory for the reference count must be dynamically allocated.** Conceptually, the reference count is associated with the object being pointed to,  
but pointed-to objects know nothing about this.  
They thus have no place to store a reference count. (A pleasant implication is that any object-even those of built-in types-may be managed by `std::shared_ptrs.`)  
Item 21 explains that the cost of the dynamic allocation is avoided when the `std::shared_ptr` is created by `std::make_shared`, but there are situations where `std::make_shared` can’t be used. Either way, the reference count is stored as dynamically allocated data.
* **Increments and decrements of the reference count must be atomic,**  

Move-constructing a `std::shared_ptr` from another `std::shared_ptr` sets the source `std::shared_ptr` to null, and that means that the old `std::shared_ptr` stops pointing to the resource at the moment the new `std::shared_ptr starts`. As a result, no reference count manipulation is required.  Moving `std::shared_ptrs` is therefore faster than copying them: copying requires incrementing the reference count, but moving doesn’t.
