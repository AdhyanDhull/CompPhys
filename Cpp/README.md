# Cpp - C++ examples for Computational Physics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

## Abstract

(20160713) I'm reading and going through 

**C++ Primer** (5th Edition) 5th Edition, by Stanley B. Lippman, JosÃ©e Lajoie, Barbara E. Moo.

Those scripts related to that is in the subdirectory `/CompPhys/Cpp/primer`, and the `README.md` there has (an incomplete) dictionary between script and reading.  

Included in this repository (repo) are code examples straight from M. Hjorth-Jensen's **Computational Physics**, University of Oslo (2015) [mhjensen](http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/people/aca/mhjensen/).  

Hjorth-Jensen's material motivated me to (try to) dive deeper into C++ and so I picked up Bjarne Stroustrup's **A Tour of C++** (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2013).  This book is based on **C++11** and I suspect that a lot of computational physics code was written *before* this 2011 (keep in mind that I still need to find a good book for C++14).  I include code for Stroustrup's **A Tour of C++** in the `./tour` subdirectory.  

> C++ feels like a new language. That is, I can express my ideas more clearly, more simply, and
more directly in C++11 than I could in C++98.  Furthermore, the resulting programs are better
checked by the compiler and run faster. -*Bjarne Stroustrup*

You're (as I was) reading Hjorth-Jensen's excellent lecture notes (latest I found is from 2015) on Computational Physics (with an emphasis on C++).  You want to run the C++ code *simultaneously* as you are reading, as I found that I learn *much* faster watching how the code works than a book explanation - along with playing around with the code "in real-time" (it makes learning fun!).  But you don't know which code follows along which part of the lectures.  So I'll try to make a listing (a dictionary) or index of code to lecture, below.  

P.S. There are some non-trivial typos both in the code and lecture that made the material confusing to understand (as in, did he really mean that?) and some things weren't obvious to me when I read it, and so I try to make sense of it in my notes in [CompPhys.pdf](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/LaTeXandpdfs/CompPhys.pdf) and have my own code type-ups here in this repository, even though there's the [CompPhys repository](https://github.com/CompPhysics).

### Compiling C++11

```
g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp

## File I/O in C and C++

### Quick and Dirty File I/O for C++

I find myself having to write out results into `.csv` text files to see what my C++ program is doing.  

Here's the raw C++ code I have in (draft) github repository `Propulsion/CUDACFD/NavierStokes/commonlib/sharedmem.cu`:

```  
// test print outs, file IO out
	std::ofstream ofile1;
	ofile1.open("testfx_sin1.csv");
	ofile1 << testfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( 0, testgrid3d.N_is[1]/2, testgrid3d.N_is[2]/2) ] ; 
	
	for (int i = 1; i < ( testgrid3d.N_is[0] ); ++i) {
		ofile1 << ", " << testfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( i, testgrid3d.N_is[1]/2, testgrid3d.N_is[2]/2) ];
	}
	ofile1 << std::endl;
	
	ofile1 << testfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( 0, 0, 0) ] ; 
	for (int i = 1; i < ( testgrid3d.N_is[0] ); ++i) {
		ofile1 << ", " << testfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( i, 0, 0 ) ];
	}
	ofile1 << std::endl;

	ofile1 << testfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( 0, testgrid3d.N_is[1]*3/4, testgrid3d.N_is[2]*3/4) ] ; 
	for (int i = 1; i < ( testgrid3d.N_is[0] ); ++i) {
		ofile1 << ", " << testfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( i, testgrid3d.N_is[1]*3/4, testgrid3d.N_is[2]*3/4)  ];
	}
	ofile1 << std::endl;

	ofile1.close();
	
	std::ofstream ofile2;
	ofile2.open("testdfx_cos1.csv");
	
	ofile2 << testdfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( 0, testgrid3d.N_is[1]/2, testgrid3d.N_is[2]/2) ] ; 
	
	for (int i = 1; i < ( testgrid3d.N_is[0] ); ++i) {
		ofile2 << ", " << testdfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( i, testgrid3d.N_is[1]/2, testgrid3d.N_is[2]/2) ];
	}
	ofile2 << std::endl;
	
	ofile2 << testdfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( 0, 0, 0) ] ; 
	for (int i = 1; i < ( testgrid3d.N_is[0] ); ++i) {
		ofile2 << ", " << testdfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( i, 0, 0 ) ];
	}
	ofile2 << std::endl;

	ofile2 << testdfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( 0, testgrid3d.N_is[1]*3/4, testgrid3d.N_is[2]*3/4) ] ; 
	for (int i = 1; i < ( testgrid3d.N_is[0] ); ++i) {
		ofile2 << ", " << testdfx[ testgrid3d.flatten( i, testgrid3d.N_is[1]*3/4, testgrid3d.N_is[2]*3/4)  ];
	}
	ofile2 << std::endl;

	ofile2.close();

	std::ofstream ofile3;
	ofile3.open("dev_testdfx_sin1.csv");
	
	ofile3 << testdfx_res[ testgrid3d.flatten( 0, testgrid3d.N_is[1]/2, testgrid3d.N_is[2]/2) ] ; 
	
	for (int i = 1; i < ( testgrid3d.N_is[0] ); ++i) {
		ofile3 << ", " << testdfx_res[ testgrid3d.flatten( i, testgrid3d.N_is[1]/2, testgrid3d.N_is[2]/2) ];
	}
	ofile3 << std::endl;
	
	ofile3 << testdfx_res[ testgrid3d.flatten( 0, 0, 0) ] ; 
	for (int i = 1; i < ( testgrid3d.N_is[0] ); ++i) {
		ofile3 << ", " << testdfx_res[ testgrid3d.flatten( i, 0, 0 ) ];
	}
	ofile3 << std::endl;

	ofile3 << testdfx_res[ testgrid3d.flatten( 0, testgrid3d.N_is[1]*3/4, testgrid3d.N_is[2]*3/4) ] ; 
	for (int i = 1; i < ( testgrid3d.N_is[0] ); ++i) {
		ofile3 << ", " << testdfx_res[ testgrid3d.flatten( i, testgrid3d.N_is[1]*3/4, testgrid3d.N_is[2]*3/4)  ];
	}
	ofile3 << std::endl;

	ofile3.close();
```  

Let's generalize this (as this is my template).  Let `testfx, testdfx, testdfx_res` be 1-dimensional arrays.  The indexing was handled by `testgrid3d.flatten`, a (I defined) class member function.  But I can have a simple indexing and looping through that index e.g. `for (int i =0; i< Lengthofmy1dimarray; ++i) { testfx[i]; // and so on }`.  

You'd have to use the `<<` C++ "operator" to input into your ofile, an "instance" of `std::ofstream` each string.  

**See also**, for an *example of usage* [Writing .csv files from C++](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25201131/writing-csv-files-from-c), in particular, this answer from [BHawk](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4434679/bhawk):
```  
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
      ofstream myfile;
      myfile.open ("example.csv");
      myfile << "This is the first cell in the first column.\n";
      myfile << "a,b,c,\n";
      myfile << "c,s,v,\n";
      myfile << "1,2,3.456\n";
      myfile << "semi;colon";
      myfile.close();
      return 0;
}
```  
This is what I implemented and adopted here in [`../moreCUDA/samples02/sinsin2dtex.cu`](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/moreCUDA/samples02/sinsin2dtex.cu).  


cf. `program1.cpp` in `./progs/ch03` subdirectory; pp. 51 Subsection 3.1.1.1 Initializations and main program, Ch. 3 Numerical differentiation and interpolation of Hjorth-Jensen (2015); [CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/
](https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/program1.cpp)

Take a look at `program1.cpp`.  It appears that the "C"-style file IO is first considered.  Reading this wikipedia article on [C file input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_file_input/output) helped me understand what was used here.

`FILE` - known as a file *handle*, abstract reference to a resource, this is an "opaque type" - points to some unspecified type - containing information about a file or text stream, and we can do IO (input output) operations on.

So `FILE *output_file;` declares a pointer `output_file` to a `FILE`. 

`stdio.h` contains `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fclose`:
- `fopen` - opens a file
- `fprintf` - prints formatted byte/wchar_t output to stdout, file stream, or buffer; syntax:

```
int fprintf_s(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict format, ...);
```
cf. http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf

[`main.cpp` of `dd_1d_global`](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/moreCUDA/cudaforengineers/dd_1d_global/main.cpp), and [`main.cpp` of `dd_1d_shared`](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/tree/master/moreCUDA/cudaforengineers/dd_1d_shared), in the `moreCUDA/cudaforengineers/dd_1d_global` and `moreCUDA/cudaforengineers/dd_1d_shared` directories, respectively, of this same repository (CompPhys) demonstrate the use of `fprintf`, and then taking that generated `.csv` file, using Python's `matplotlib` on a `jupyter` notebook for "data visualization" (plotting).  

- `fclose` - closes a file

cf. `program3.cpp` in `./progs/ch03` subdirectory, pp. 54-55, Subsection 3.1.1.4 The output function of Hjorth-Jensen (2015), [CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/
](https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/program3.cpp)

#### `<fstream>` header

cf. http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/

`<fstream>` in `#include <fstream>` is a header providing file stream classes.  So apparently, for narrow characters [`char`], there is `fstream` (input/output file stream class) and `ofstream` (output file stream).

In `program3.cpp`, `ofile` is an "instance" of class `ofstream`:

```
ofstream ofile;
```
Here are examples of using this class `ofstream` (in this particular situation, its "instance" is called `ofile`):

```
ofile.open(outfilename);
ofile.close();
```
and then the actual "outputting":

```
ofile << setw(15) << setprecision(8) << log10(h_step[i]);
ofile << setw(15) << setprecision(8) << epsilon << endl;
```

`setw` is a class belonging to `<iomanip>`.  It stands for **Set field width** and sets the *field width* to be used on output operations (cf. http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iomanip/setw/ ).  

#### `.csv` file output of an array for C++

[Export data from an array to a csv file](http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/general/170845/)

From [Duoas](http://www.cplusplus.com/user/Duoas/) answer,

> Don't forget to put something (like a comma) between outputs. This takes a little thinking, 
> because you want to see:
```
    1,2,3,4
```
> and not:
```
    1,2,3,4,
```

Fortunately, that's a pretty simple fix:

```  
// for each row
for (i=0; ...)
{
  // print first column's element
  outfile << arr[i][0];

  // print remaining columns
  for (j=1; ...)
  {
    outfile << ", " << arr[i][j];
  }

  // print newline between rows
  outfile << endl;
}
```  
#### Examples of Usage

As mentioned before, examples of good usage, in particular of `fprintf`, are [`main.cpp` of `dd_1d_global`](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/moreCUDA/cudaforengineers/dd_1d_global/main.cpp), and [`main.cpp` of `dd_1d_shared`](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/tree/master/moreCUDA/cudaforengineers/dd_1d_shared), in the `moreCUDA/cudaforengineers/dd_1d_global` and `moreCUDA/cudaforengineers/dd_1d_shared` directories, respectively, of this same repository (CompPhys), demonstrating the use of `fprintf`, and then taking that generated `.csv` file, using Python's `matplotlib` on a `jupyter` notebook for "data visualization" (plotting).  




## Classes (C++)

See `complex.h, complex.cpp, customCC.cpp` in `./progs/ch03` subdirectory for useful (pedagogical) examples.

### header files

Define header file (e.g. complex.h) which contains declarations of the class.
The header file contains
- class declaration (data and functions)
- declaration of stand-alone functions, and all inlined functions,

To understand

```
#ifndef HEADERFILE_H  
#define HEADERFILE_H  
```

See (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1653958/why-are-ifndef-and-define-used-in-c-header-files) and (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard).

### Modularity

Stroustrup makes a chapter on *Modularity.*  Here's what I found in practice.  

I wanted to test out a new class which I want to put in a header file, with its class definition split away in another `.cpp` file.  This is because the header file is the "interface" and the definition is separated.

Then I wanted to have a test `main` function in a directory "above."  Next, I wanted to compile it to test it out.  In the command prompt, you'd do something like this:

```  
g++ -std=c++14 testR3grid.cpp ./physlib/R3grid.cpp ./physlib/R3grid.h  
```

i.e. you're going to have to include all the files in that command line for `g++`.

[33.2 How do I pass a pointer-to-member-function to a signal handler, X event callback, system call that starts a thread/task, etc?](http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/function.html#fqa-33.2)

>  FAQ: You don't. A member function can't be used without an object of the class, so the whole thing can't work. What you can do is write a non-member function wrapping your pointer-to-member-function call.

> For example, thread creation callbacks usually have a void* argument. You could pass an object pointer in that argument to the callback (which has to be a non-member). The callback would then cast the void* down to the actual type and call the object's method.

> Some functions, like signal, use callbacks without a void* argument or anything similar. In that case, you have no choice but save a pointer to the object in a global variable. The callback can get the object pointer from that global variable and call the method.

> static member functions can be used in the contexts where a C callback is expected, if they are extern "C". Although on most compilers it would probably work without extern "C", the standard says it doesn't have to work. 

This also answers 33.3 Why do I keep getting compile errors (type mismatch) when I try to use a member function as an interrupt service routine?

So a member function of a class can't be used without an object (in my case, an "instantiation") of the class, so the function can't be an argument, or passed by value or passed by reference, to another (outside) function.


## Makefiles

### Useful links

- [Using make and writing Makefiles from cs.swarthmore.edu](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/howto_makefiles.html)

[isaacs's excellent "glossary" explanation of Makefiles](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/62a2d1825d04437c6f08)

### Makefiles, quick and dirty, or my experience so far

First thing that I had to learn first was from 2.4 Variables Make Makefiles Simpler of the GNU make "manual."

Define variables by `=` sign and then, for each place we want to put the variable, e.g. `CPP = g++ -std=c++14` substitute in the variable's value by writing `$(CPP)`.  See [How to Use Variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Using-Variables).  Apparently, in 6.1 Basics of Variable References, `$(CPP)` and `${CPP}` are the same thing - parentheses or braces can be used (they do the same thing apparently (!!!)).

#### Glossary (for Makefiles)

From [isaac](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/62a2d1825d04437c6f08)
- `$@` The file that is being made right now by this rule (aka the "target").  You can remember this because it's like the `$@` list in a shell script  
- `$<`  The input file (that is, the first prerequisite in the list).  You can remember this because the `<` is like a file input pipe in bash.  
- `$^`  This is the list of ALL input files, not just the first one.  You can remember it because it's like `$<`, but turned up a notch.  If a file shows up more than once in the input list for some reason, it's still only going to show one time in `$^`.

At this point, knowing what some "commonly used" `g++` compiler flags mean would help.  

From [die.net `g++(1)` - Linux man page](http://linux.die.net/man/1/g++)

- `-c` -- Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link. The linking stage simply is not done. The ultimate output is in the form of an object file for each source file.  
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix `.c, .i, .s`, etc., with `.o`.
- `-o` *file* -- Place output in file file. This applies regardless to whatever sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file, an object `f`.

## C++ Operator Overloading in expression; lvalues vs. rvalues

cf. [C++ Operator Overloading in expression](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6377786/c-operator-overloading-in-expression)

Take a look at this link: [C++ Operator Overloading in expression](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6377786/c-operator-overloading-in-expression).  This point isn't emphasized enough, as in Hjorth-Jensen (2015).  This makes doing something like  

```
d = a*c + d/b
```

work the way we expect.  Kudos to user [fredoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/252000/fredoverflow) for his answer:

``The expression `(e_x*u_c)` is a rvalue, and references to non-const won't bind to rvalues.

Also, member functions should be marked `const` as well.''  

### What are lvalues and rvalues in C and C++?

[C++ Rvalue References Explained](http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html)

Original definition of *lvalues* and *rvalues* from *C*:  
*lvalue* - expression `e` that may appear on the left or on the right hand side of an assignment  
*rvalue* - expression that can only appear on right hand side of assignment =.

Examples:

```
  int a = 42;
  int b = 43;

  // a and b are both l-values
  a = b; // ok
  b = a; // ok
  a = a * b; // ok

  // a * b is an rvalue:
  int c = a * b; // ok, rvalue on right hand side of assignment
  a * b = 42; // error, rvalue on left hand side of assignment
  
```

In *C++*, this is still useful as a first, intuitive approach, but   
*lvalue* - expression that refers to a memory location and allows us to take the address of that memory location via the & operator.  
*rvalue* - expression that's not a lvalue

So & reference *functor* can't act on rvalue's.

### Results of Numerical Integration

See the lecture notes (2015) of Hjorth-Jensen; pp. 128, Ch. 5 Numerical Integration, Tables 5.2-5.3.  I wanted to reproduce those results.

My thought is that making a "smaller" file containing only the 1-dimensional (numerical) integration routines would be more useful (pedagogically).  Hence, including `integrate1d.h` header file in the working directory, you'd compile

```
g++ program1.cpp integrate1d.cpp
```

i.e. compile `program1.cpp` with `integrate1d.cpp` and then one can integrate your desired integrand, by including those "integrate1d" files.

My results are as follows:
