# Cpp - C++ examples for Computational Physics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

## Abstract

Included in this repository (repo) are code examples straight from M. Hjorth-Jensen's **Computational Physics**, University of Oslo (2015) [mhjensen](http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/people/aca/mhjensen/).  

## Listing of which program or script corresponds to which section, chapter, part for Hjorth-Jensen's material

See Hjorth-Jensen's lectures for 2015.
