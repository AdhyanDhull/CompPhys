# Cpp - C++ examples for Computational Physics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

## Abstract

Included in this repository (repo) are code examples straight from M. Hjorth-Jensen's **Computational Physics**, University of Oslo (2015) [mhjensen](http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/people/aca/mhjensen/).  

Hjorth-Jensen's material motivated me to (try to) dive deeper into C++ and so I picked up Bjarne Stroustrup's **A Tour of C++** (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2013).  This book is based on **C++11** and I suspect that a lot of computational physics code was written *before* this 2011 (keep in mind that I still need to find a good book for C++14).  I include code for Stroustrup's **A Tour of C++** in the `./tour` subdirectory.  

> C++ feels like a new language. That is, I can express my ideas more clearly, more simply, and
more directly in C++11 than I could in C++98.  Furthermore, the resulting programs are better
checked by the compiler and run faster. -*Bjarne Stroustrup*

You're (as I was) reading Hjorth-Jensen's excellent lecture notes (latest I found is from 2015) on Computational Physics (with an emphasis on C++).  You want to run the C++ code *simultaneously* as you are reading, as I found that I learn *much* faster watching how the code works than a book explanation - along with playing around with the code "in real-time" (it makes learning fun!).  But you don't know which code follows along which part of the lectures.  So I'll try to make a listing (a dictionary) or index of code to lecture, below.  

P.S. There are some non-trivial typos both in the code and lecture that made the material confusing to understand (as in, did he really mean that?) and some things weren't obvious to me when I read it, and so I try to make sense of it in my notes in [CompPhys.pdf](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/LaTeXandpdfs/CompPhys.pdf) and have my own code type-ups here in this repository, even though there's the [CompPhys repository](https://github.com/CompPhysics).

20160629 I continue this incomplete listing in the [README.md](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/Cpp/tour/README.md) of the [tour subdirectory](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/tree/master/Cpp/tour) - go there for the entire list.  

### Compiling C++11
This worked for me, as I had obtained a c++11 compiling error when I trued to use `for (char ch: act) { ... }`:

```
g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp
```

### File I/O in C and C++

cf. `program1.cpp` in `./progs/ch03` subdirectory; pp. 51 Subsection 3.1.1.1 Initializations and main program, Ch. 3 Numerical differentiation and interpolation of Hjorth-Jensen (2015); [CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/
](https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/program1.cpp)

Take a look at `program1.cpp`.  It appears that the "C"-style file IO is first considered.  Reading this wikipedia article on [C file input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_file_input/output) helped me understand what was used here.

`FILE` - known as a file *handle*, abstract reference to a resource, this is an "opaque type" - points to some unspecified type - containing information about a file or text stream, and we can do IO (input output) operations on.

So `FILE *output_file;` declares a pointer `output_file` to a `FILE`. 

`stdio.h` contains `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fclose`:
- `fopen` - opens a file
- `fprintf` - prints formatted byte/wchar_t output to stdout, file stream, or buffer; syntax:

```
int fprintf_s(FILE *restrict stream, const char *restrict format, ...);
```
cf. http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf

- `fclose` - closes a file

cf. `program3.cpp` in `./progs/ch03` subdirectory, pp. 54-55, Subsection 3.1.1.4 The output function of Hjorth-Jensen (2015), [CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/
](https://github.com/CompPhysics/ComputationalPhysicsMSU/blob/master/doc/Programs/LecturePrograms/programs/Classes/cpp/program3.cpp)

#### `<fstream>` header

cf. http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/

`<fstream>` in `#include <fstream>` is a header providing file stream classes.  So apparently, for narrow characters [`char`], there is `fstream` (input/output file stream class) and `ofstream` (output file stream).

In `program3.cpp`, `ofile` is an "instance" of class `ofstream`:

```
ofstream ofile;
```
Here are examples of using this class `ofstream` (in this particular situation, its "instance" is called `ofile`):

```
ofile.open(outfilename);
ofile.close();
```
and then the actual "outputting":

```
ofile << setw(15) << setprecision(8) << log10(h_step[i]);
ofile << setw(15) << setprecision(8) << epsilon << endl;
```

`setw` is a class belonging to `<iomanip>`.  It stands for **Set field width** and sets the *field width* to be used on output operations (cf. http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iomanip/setw/ ).  

### Classes (C++)

See `complex.h, complex.cpp, customCC.cpp` in `./progs/ch03` subdirectory for useful (pedagogical) examples.

## header files

Define header file (e.g. complex.h) which contains declarations of the class.
The header file contains
- class declaration (data and functions)
- declaration of stand-alone functions, and all inlined functions,

To understand

```
#ifndef HEADERFILE_H  
#define HEADERFILE_H  
```

See (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1653958/why-are-ifndef-and-define-used-in-c-header-files) and (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard).

## Modularity

Stroustrup makes a chapter on *Modularity.*  Here's what I found in practice.  

I wanted to test out a new class which I want to put in a header file, with its class definition split away in another `.cpp` file.  This is because the header file is the "interface" and the definition is separated.

Then I wanted to have a test `main` function in a directory "above."  Next, I wanted to compile it to test it out.  With a Makefile, you'd do something like this:

```  
g++ -std=c++14 testR3grid.cpp ./physlib/R3grid.cpp ./physlib/R3grid.h  
```

i.e. you're going to have to include all the files in that command line for `g++`.

### C++ Operator Overloading in expression; lvalues vs. rvalues

cf. [C++ Operator Overloading in expression](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6377786/c-operator-overloading-in-expression)

Take a look at this link: [C++ Operator Overloading in expression](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6377786/c-operator-overloading-in-expression).  This point isn't emphasized enough, as in Hjorth-Jensen (2015).  This makes doing something like  

```
d = a*c + d/b
```

work the way we expect.  Kudos to user [fredoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/252000/fredoverflow) for his answer:

``The expression `(e_x*u_c)` is a rvalue, and references to non-const won't bind to rvalues.

Also, member functions should be marked `const` as well.''  

#### What are lvalues and rvalues in C and C++?

[C++ Rvalue References Explained](http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_01.html)

Original definition of *lvalues* and *rvalues* from *C*:  
*lvalue* - expression `e` that may appear on the left or on the right hand side of an assignment  
*rvalue* - expression that can only appear on right hand side of assignment =.

Examples:

```
  int a = 42;
  int b = 43;

  // a and b are both l-values
  a = b; // ok
  b = a; // ok
  a = a * b; // ok

  // a * b is an rvalue:
  int c = a * b; // ok, rvalue on right hand side of assignment
  a * b = 42; // error, rvalue on left hand side of assignment
  
```

In *C++*, this is still useful as a first, intuitive approach, but   
*lvalue* - expression that refers to a memory location and allows us to take the address of that memory location via the & operator.  
*rvalue* - expression that's not a lvalue

So & reference *functor* can't act on rvalue's.

### Results of Numerical Integration

See the lecture notes (2015) of Hjorth-Jensen; pp. 128, Ch. 5 Numerical Integration, Tables 5.2-5.3.  I wanted to reproduce those results.

My thought is that making a "smaller" file containing only the 1-dimensional (numerical) integration routines would be more useful (pedagogically).  Hence, including `integrate1d.h` header file in the working directory, you'd compile

```
g++ program1.cpp integrate1d.cpp
```

i.e. compile `program1.cpp` with `integrate1d.cpp` and then one can integrate your desired integrand, by including those "integrate1d" files.

My results are as follows:
