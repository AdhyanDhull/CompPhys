# Cpp - C++ examples for Computational Physics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

## Abstract

Included in this repository (repo) are code examples straight from M. Hjorth-Jensen's **Computational Physics**, University of Oslo (2015) [mhjensen](http://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/people/aca/mhjensen/).  

You're (as I was) reading Hjorth-Jensen's excellent lecture notes (latest I found is from 2015) on Computational Physics (with an emphasis on C++).  You want to run the C++ code *simultaneously* as you are reading, as I found that I learn *much* faster watching how the code works than a book explanation - along with playing around with the code "in real-time" (it makes learning fun!).  But you don't know which code follows along which part of the lectures.  So I'll try to make a listing (a dictionary) or index of code to lecture, below.  

P.S. There are some non-trivial typos both in the code and lecture that made the material confusing to understand (as in, did he really mean that?) and some things weren't obvious to me when I read it, and so I try to make sense of it in my notes in [CompPhys.pdf](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/LaTeXandpdfs/CompPhys.pdf) and have my own code type-ups here in this repository, even though there's the [CompPhys repository](https://github.com/CompPhysics).

## Listing of which program or script corresponds to which section, chapter, part for Hjorth-Jensen's material

See Hjorth-Jensen's lectures for 2015.  

| codename        | directory      | Chapter | Section | page (pp) | Description            |
| --------------- | -------------- | :-----: | ------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| program1.cpp    | ./progs/ch02/  | 2       | 2.1.1   | 10        | Scientific Hello World!|
| program7.cpp    | ./progs/ch02/  | 2       | 2.5.2   | 34        | Pointers and arrays in C++ |
| program7b.cpp   | ./progs/ch02/  | 2       | 2.5.2   | 34        | Pointers and arrays in C++ (further experimentation by me) |
| usecomplex.cpp  | ./progs/ch03/  | 3       | 3.3.1   | 68        | Using standard template library (STL) for <complex>, complex<double>  |
| usecomplexb.cpp | ./progs/ch03/  | 3       | 3.3.1   | 68        | More usage, such as x.real(), x.imag(), and exp(z) by me |
