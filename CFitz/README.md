# CFitz - C examples for Computational Physics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)

## Abstract

Included in this repository (repo) are code examples straight from Richard Fitzpatrick's  **Computational Physics**

You're (as I was) reading Fitzpatrick's excellent lecture notes (latest I found is from  [here](http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/329/329.pdf)) on Computational Physics (with an emphasis on C).  You want to run the C code *simultaneously* as you are reading, as I found that I learn *much* faster watching how the code works than a book explanation - along with playing around with the code "in real-time" (it makes learning fun!).  But you don't know which code follows along which part of the lectures.  So I'll try to make a listing (a dictionary) or index of code to lecture, below.  


## Listing of which program or script corresponds to which section, chapter, part for Fitzpatrick's material



| codename        | directory      | Chapter | Section | page (pp) | Description            |
| --------------- | -------------- | :-----: | ------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| printfact3.c    | ./             | 2       | 2.10    | 58        | uses a pointer to pass back information from a function to its calling routine |
