# CUDA for Engineers

This subdirectory in `CompPhys`, `CompPhys/moreCUDA/cudaforengineers` is a "mirror" of the [cudaforengineers](https://github.com/myurtoglu/cudaforengineers) repository by, presumably, the authors of *CUDA for Engineers*, Duane Storti and Mete Yurtoglu, but with my modifications, and stripped of Visual Studio "boilerplate."

| `dist_3d`                | Chapter 7. Interacting with 3D Data | Launching 3D Computational Grids: `dist_3d` | This seems like a Euclidean norm implementation in 3-dimensions illustrating the use of a 3-dim. grid with 3-dim. blocks: see [my notes](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/LaTeXandpdfs/CompPhys.pdf), the section on *global thread Indexing: 1-dim., 2-dim., 3-dim.* for a full generalization |
