# `CompPhys/moreCUDA/CUSOLVER/`
==============================
- Includes pedagogical (and simple) examples of using `cuSOLVER`

## CUDA Toolkit Documentation/API for `cuSOLVER`

I refer back to the CUDA Toolkit Documentation directly, and click through the pages to find what I need so much that I took notes here.

cf. [cuSolverDN: Dense LAPACK](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusolver/index.html#cuds-intro)

### [`cusolverDn<t>gesvd()`](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusolver/index.html#cuds-lt-t-gt-gesvd)

cf. [`cusolverDn<t>gesvd()`](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusolver/index.html#cuds-lt-t-gt-gesvd)

Note that the `<t>` means it's a wildcard, i.e. place holder, for what `<t>` could possibly be: in this case it can be either "S","D","C", or only "Z" (no quotation marks, only the single letter itself).  This wasn't obvious to be the first time.    
    
"S" - real-valued single precision
"D" - real-valued double precision
"C" - complex-valued single precision
"Z" - complex-valued double precision   

So this is documentation for *4* different functions,
- `cusolverDnSgesvd`   
- `cusolverDnDgesvd`
- `cusolverDnCgesvd`
- `cusolverDnZgesvd`   

*First*, these are the the helper functions below that can calculate the sizes needed for pre-allocated buffer.   


```   
cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnDgesvd_bufferSize(
	cusolverDnHandle_t handle,
	int m,   
	int n,
	int *lwork);


cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnSgesvd_bufferSize(
	cusolverDnHandle_t handle,
	int m,   
	int n,
	int *lwork);

cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnDgesvd_bufferSize(
	cusolverDnHandle_t handle,
	int m,
	int n,
	int *lwork );   

cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnCgesvd_bufferSize(
	cusolverDnHandle_t handle,
	int m,
	int n,
	int *lwork );   

cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnZgesvd_bufferSize(
	cusolverDnHandle_t handle,
	int m,
	int n,
	int *lwork );   
```   
```   
cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnDgesvd (
	cusolverDnHandle_t handle,
	signed char jobu,
	signed char jobvt,
	int m,   
	int n,
	double *A,
	int lda,
	double *S,
	double *U,
	int ldu,
	double *VT,
	int ldvt,
	double *work,  int lwork,
	double *rwork,
	int *devInfo);

```   

The C and Z data types are complex valued single and double precision, respectively.  
```   
cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnCgesvd (
	cusolverDnHandle_t handle,   
	signed char jobu,   
	signed char jobvt,   
	int m,   
	int n,   
	cuComplex *A,   
	int lda,
	float *S,   
	cuComplex *U,
	int ldu,
	cuComplex *VT,
	int ldvt,
	cuComplex *work,
	int lwork,
	float *rwork,
	int *devInfo);   
   
cusolverStatus_t
cusolverDnZgesvd(
	cusolverDnHandle_t handle,
	signed char jobu,   
	signed char jobvt,
	int m,   
	int n,
	cuDoubleComplex *A,
	int lda,
	double *S,
	cuDoubleComplex *U,
	int ldu,
	cuDoubleComplex *VT,
	int ldvt,
	cuDoubleComplex *work,
	int lwork,
	double *rwork,
	int *devInfo);   
```   

This function computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a `mxn` matrix `A` and corresponding the left and/or right singular vectors.  The SVD is written

$$
	A = U * \Sigma * V^H   
$$   
i.e.

	A = U * S * V^H

where $\Sigma$ or S is a `mxn` matrix which is 0 except for its `min(m,n)` diagonal elements, `U` is a `mxm` unitary matrix, and `V` is a `nxn` unitary matrix.  

Remark 1: **`gesvd` only supports `m>=n`.  


**API of gesvd**   

| parameter        | Memory  | In/out | Meaning |
| ---------------- | :------------: | :---------------------- | :---------- |
| `jobu`           | host   | input  | specifies options for computing all or part of the matrix `U`     
  	    	     	      := `A`: all m columns of U are returned in array U    
			      := `S`: the first min(m,n) columns of U (the left singular vectors are returned in the array U;   
			      := `O`: the first min(m,n) columns of U (the left singular vectors) are overwritten on the array A;
		      	      := `N`: no columns of U (no left singular vectors) are computed.    |

## Notes on compiling `cuSOLVER` scripts (with `nvcc`)

Currently (20170703), I use Fedora 23 Workstation (with a 980Ti), where I have manually, in root, made various symbolic links haphazardly, and on the Dell Inspiron 15 in. 7000 Gaming (1050; Dell, please sponsor me and my scientific and engineering endeavors!), Ubuntu 16.02 LTS, where I only do `apt-get` first, and maintains this OS with as little changes as possible (adding new software, no manually changes to `/usr/*`, etc.).  I will refer to Fedora first.  

[`SVD_vectors.cu`](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/moreCUDA/CUSOLVER/SVD_vectors.cu) is the gold standard, being an exact copy of the example given in the [CUDA Toolkit documentation](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusolver/index.html#svd_examples).  

This worked (on Fedora 23):
```
nvcc -c SVD_vectors.cu   
g++ -fopenmp -o a.out SVD_vectors.o -L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 -lcudart -lcublas -lcusolver   
```   

When I did this, the following error(s) was obtained:
```
nvcc -c -I/usr/local/cuda/include SVD_vectors.cu   
/usr/local/cuda/include/surface_functions.h(134): error: expected a ";"
```   

But this also worked:   
```  
nvcc -std=c++11 -arch='sm_52' -lcublas -lcusolver SVD_vectors.cu -o SVD_vectors.exe   
```

This get tricky when implementing CUDA Unified Memory Management:  consider [`SVD_vectors_unified.cu`](https://github.com/ernestyalumni/CompPhys/blob/master/moreCUDA/CUSOLVER/SVD_vectors_unified.cu)

I found this to work, computing `U,S,VT` correctly, but not the error checks:
```
nvcc -std=c++11 -arch='sm_52' -lcudart -lcublas -lcusolver SVD_vectors_unified.cu -o SVD_vectors_unified.exe
```
